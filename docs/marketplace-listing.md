# Marketplace Listing — draft copy (Maker Console)

## Plugin name

NaN Dashboard

## Tagline (short)

Track your NaN AI usage on Stream Deck.

## Description (long)

NaN Dashboard brings your NaN AI usage to Stream Deck. See your remaining quota on a Stream Deck+ dial, or put NaN actions on standard keys: model consumption, total tokens and month-to-date tokens.

- **NaN Usage dial (Stream Deck+):** rotate/touch to refresh your quota; high-contrast warning levels when you run low.
- **NaN Model Usage / Total Tokens / Monthly Tokens (Stream Deck & Stream Deck+):** live keypad tiles that refresh automatically.
- **Secure session import:** connect your NaN session once in the action's configuration panel. On macOS, click **Import session from Chrome**; on Windows, paste a **Copy as cURL** request from your browser developer tools and click **Save session**. Your session is validated and stored in the macOS Keychain, or in a current-user DPAPI-protected file on Windows. Nothing is sent anywhere except the NaN Dashboard API, with your own session.
- **Bonus monitors (no NaN account needed):** Claude Code usage and OpenAI Codex usage dials. A Grok monitor is experimental.

Requires macOS 13+ or Windows 10+ and the Stream Deck 7.1+ app. NaN account required for NaN actions; on macOS, Chrome is required for the session import. The plugin is open source: <https://github.com/refactor-ia/streamdeck-nan>.

## SDK 3 and DRM (resolved 2026-09-11)

The Maker Console rejects submissions with `SDKVersion: 2` and DRM off. Per official docs, DRM requires the official `@elgato/streamdeck` library v2+ (we bundle 2.1.0), `SDKVersion: 3`, and `Software.MinimumVersion` 6.9+ (ours is 7.1). The manifest now declares `SDKVersion: 3`; DRM activation happens portal-side after upload and processing. DRM applies to the Marketplace copy; the GitHub-release `.streamDeckPlugin` remains unprotected by design.

## Open portal questions (verify at submission)

- Exact review checklist and privacy requirements for plugins that read browser cookies on macOS (declare Chrome access explicitly and link the privacy policy); confirm how the Windows paste path, which never reads Chrome, should be described.
- Whether unsigned bundles are accepted for review the same way direct distribution is, or whether signing (#14) should land first.
- Screenshot dimensions/format required by the portal.

## Review round 1 (2026-09-16, v1.0.11) — requires changes

Feedback: (1) update product-page media to better showcase the product (reference: Elgato Volume Controller page and the gallery guidelines); (2) email a short demo video to maker@elgato.com so functionality can be verified. No technical objection was raised. Response: hardware photos added as the first two gallery items; demo video already emailed; resubmit the same version via Products → Versions.
